# Manual Setup (No Project Environment)

(If you have problems, or need more details, follow the Auto Installation) <br>
Install:
- git
- Python 3.8
- `pip install future`
- then `cd` into the `./main` folder and you'll be ready to run code
- some example commands: `python autograder.py`, `python pacman.py`, `python pacman.py --help`. You can also look at `./commmands/project/pacman_examples` to see different options for arguments.
